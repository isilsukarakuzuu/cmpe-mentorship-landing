Atıl",shortDescription:"PhD student in NLP at Penn State, with experience in bioinformatics and machine learning research.",description:`
I’m a third-year PhD student in NLP at Pennsylvania State University. I’ve been actively involved in research for over five years, with a focus on NLP and bioinformatics. During my Bachelor's studies at Bogazici University, I worked with research groups on topics like bioinformatics (drug-protein interaction predictions) and presented my work at RECOMB. I have also done research at University of Twente when I as an Erasmus student, which was about predicting new web links on webpages for efficient web crawling.

Currently, my research centers around offensiveness of large language models, and I am particularly interested in detection of those content and mitigation of this possibility from LLMs.
`,interests:`
I’m deeply interested in academic research and how it can contribute to solving complex real-world problems. I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of social sciences, machine learning and NLP, and I’m passionate about sharing knowledge and collaborating with others who are curious about research.

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, hiking, beach volleyball and soccer, and always appreciate meaningful conversations beyond academia too.
`,offerings:["Understanding different academic paths and how to choose your field","Exploring suitable programs and universities for MSc, PhD, research internships","Preparing application documents like your motivation letter and CV","Discussing research interests like NLP, machine learning, bioinformatics","I’m especially keen to support students considering a future in interdisciplinary science, ML research or academia more broadly."],expectations:`
Mentorship works best when it’s a two-way exchange. I value mentees who are genuinely curious, eager to grow, and committed to learning. If you’re considering a future in academia and are ready to explore research topics in depth, I’d be glad to support you on that journey.`,photo:Nt,linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/berk-at%C4%B1l-7316b5133/"},{name:"Başak Önder",shortDescription:"Quantitative Technologist at Qube Research & Technologies, ex-Meta intern, systems and algorithms engineer.",description:`
Currently, I’m a Quantitative Technologist in Qube Research & Technologies in London and focused on system-level engineering challenges in quantitative finance, implementing C++ and using Linux environment mostly.

I joined to QRT as a Quantitative Technologist Analyst (new grad position) and still working at the same company for aroung 2 years now since I like the tech we are building, conditions and wlb of my job, and the number in my paycheck :)
We are developing and maintaining low-latency, high-frequency trading infrastructure, primarily using C++ and Python. I’ve been contributing to build connectivity with the new exchange platforms and support real-time trading systems across multiple asset classes. My work involves deep collaboration with trader desks and technical teams to ensure efficient market access and robust trading flows.

Before joining Qube, I completed internships at Meta and Turkcell. For the first mandatory internship, I only got accepted from Turkcell as Artificial Intelligence Intern. I briefly had experience on ML-related works; I contributed to NLP tools and sentiment analysis projects. It was not very improving internship to be honest. Then I got accepted from Meta for my second internship. At Meta, I worked on the backend side of WhatsApp Business. Mostly implemented APIs related to media items in Whatsapp, using multithreading applications. Project was mainly written in C++/QT, I also experienced with PHP, Docker, and SQL database services. It was a very valuable opportunity for me to become a part of a big software company.

I applied so many different companies worldwide both for internship and new-grad positions, and I am very familiar with their interview processes. I have a foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. I attended the Algorithm Camp by Inzva Foundation and I had been studying math olympiads for about 6 years. These experiences helped shape my analytical skills and passion for algorithms.`,interests:`
I’m not very passionate about work in general. I am more of a "work for live” kind of person.
